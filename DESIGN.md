    a list of classes and public methods (and their return types and/or arguments) that you’ve decided to implement

    advanced sketches of UIs that clearly explain which features are connected to which underlying classes

    a list of APIs and frameworks that you will be using to provide functionality in your app

    a list of data sources, and database tables and fields (and their types) that you’ve decided to implement
