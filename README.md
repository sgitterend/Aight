# Aight
#### For Android
Aight is a new way for people to get together. If you are going to do something right now and want people to join in, you simply create an 'aight'.

Everyone who has the app and is nearby will be notified, and in no-time you will have a great time together.
The user interface is as intuitive as possible, which makes it fun and easy to use.


So when you're not looking for specific people, but you just want to hang out? just Aight!
