# Aight

## Proposal document

This design document contains all foreseen needed knowledge, methods, data and needed features to create a social app for Android devices with a minimum SDK API level of 7.

## Description
The idea of the app ‘Aight’ is to allow people to meet and enjoy activities together in real life. Often people are open to sharing an activity with anyone. To make this easier, I will make Aight.

## Design
The app will use android support library v7 for most of its functionality. It is designed with android 2.1 (API level 7) required as a minimum to run correctly.

	
## MVC
### Controller
An onclicklistener will be used to determine the location and length of the user press, and to initiate a shot.

## Model
### The model determines what the view will display on the screen. So all the ‘rules’ and settings of the game, state of and coordinates of objects, are in the model. This includes the AndEngine and the ‘physics’ that is required for this game.

## View
### The view will render the screen. The model tells it where to show every object and instance. This consists of at least ‘floor’, ‘cannon1’, ‘cannon2’ and after an attack ‘cannonBall’
